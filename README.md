# Seren Local

AI chat with 90+ tools, running locally on your machine.

## What is Seren?

Seren is an AI assistant that connects to multiple AI models (Claude, GPT, and more) through the Seren Gateway. It includes access to MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for email, calendar, databases, web search, and dozens of other integrations.

## How It Works

One install command downloads the Seren Local runtime. Run `seren-local` and the app opens in your default browser at `http://localhost:19420`. Everything runs on your machine — Seren hosts nothing except the Gateway API.

### What you get

- AI chat with multiple models
- 90+ MCP tools via the Seren Gateway
- **File explorer** — browse, read, and edit local files
- **AI coding agents** — spawn Claude Code or Codex to work on your projects
- **OpenClaw messaging** — connect WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and Signal
- **Crypto wallet** — sign x402 payments with USDC on Base
- **Persistent storage** — conversations stored in a local SQLite database
- Publisher marketplace (Firecrawl, Perplexity, databases, and more)

## Installing

### macOS / Linux

```sh
curl -fsSL https://serendb.com/install | sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://serendb.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

### What the installer does

1. Downloads Node.js to `~/.seren-local/node/` (if you don't have Node 20+)
2. Installs `@serendb/runtime` via npm into `~/.seren-local/`
3. Adds `~/.seren-local/bin` to your PATH

### Running Seren Local

```sh
seren-local
```

The runtime starts on `localhost:19420` and opens your browser automatically.

### Uninstalling

Remove the Seren directory:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.seren-local
```

On Windows:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.seren-local"
```

## For Developers

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/serenorg/seren-local.git
cd seren-local
pnpm install
```

### Development

```sh
pnpm dev              # Start the SPA dev server on port 3000
```

To develop the local runtime:

```sh
cd runtime
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # Start runtime with hot reload on port 19420
```

### Building the Embedded App

```sh
pnpm build:embed      # Build SPA and copy to runtime/public/
```

This builds the SPA and copies it into `runtime/public/` so the runtime can serve it directly.

### Testing

```sh
pnpm test             # SPA unit tests
cd runtime && pnpm test   # Runtime unit tests
```

### Building

```sh
pnpm build            # Build SPA for production
cd runtime && pnpm build  # Build runtime
```

### Linting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (not ESLint/Prettier):

```sh
pnpm check            # Check all
pnpm check:fix        # Auto-fix
```

```

## For AI Agents

If you are an AI agent working on this codebase:

- The SPA is built with **SolidJS** (not React). Use SolidJS patterns: `createSignal`, `createStore`, `Show`, `For`.
- All API calls go through `src/services/`. Never call fetch in components.
- The bridge layer (`src/lib/bridge.ts`) routes calls to either IndexedDB (offline) or the local runtime (when connected).
- The runtime communicates via JSON-RPC over WebSocket on port 19420.
- The runtime serves the embedded SPA from `runtime/public/` on the same port.
- Use Biome for formatting and linting, not ESLint or Prettier.
- Never import from `@tauri-apps/*` — this is a pure browser app.
